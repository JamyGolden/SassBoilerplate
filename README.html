<h1>SassBoilerplate</h1>
<p>A Sass boilerplate for the BEM methodology.</p>
<h2>Prepros Usage</h2>
<p>When using Prepros make sure &quot;Use Compass&quot; is ticked and &quot;Full Compass Support&quot; is <em>not</em> ticked.</p>
<p>Note: This is currently not a boilerplate, but more of an example of which direction to go in when building an app this way. This will soon become a proper boilerplate.</p>
